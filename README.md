# TEMPERATURE CONVERTOR

A simple and user-friendly application to convert temperatures between **Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin**.  
This project started as a Python program and was transformed into a clean web-based GUI for better accessibility.

---

## Technology Used
* **Python** → For Basic prototype 
* **HTML5** → Structure of the web page  
* **CSS3** → Styling and responsive design  
* **JavaScript (ES6)** → Conversion logic and interactivity  

---

## Features
* Convert between **Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin** instantly  
* **Clean and simple GUI** with dropdown selection  
* **Validation** for invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values, negative Kelvin)  
* **Responsive design** that works on desktop and mobile  
* Clear and formatted results with two decimal precision  

---

## Process
* **Initial Program**: Wrote the temperature converter in Python (console-based).  
* **Web Transformation**: Rebuilt the logic using JavaScript for browser execution.  
* **GUI Design**: Designed a minimal, card-style interface with HTML & CSS.  
* **Hosting**: Deployed the project using GitHub Pages / Netlify for easy sharing.

## What I Learned
* How to **translate console-based logic into web applications**  
* Basics of **DOM manipulation** in JavaScript  
* Importance of **user experience (UX)** in project design  
* How to **host and deploy projects online** for recruiters and collaborators  

---

## How It Could Be Improved
* Add **dark mode toggle** for better accessibility  
* Provide **real-time conversion** (auto-update without button click)  
* Include **temperature history log** for multiple conversions  
* Enhance with **React.js or Vue.js** for scalability  
* Add **unit tests** to ensure accuracy and reliability
